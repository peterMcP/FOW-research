## About the project

On this research of theory and code, i tried to compact the most relevant information that i found after a lot of internet diving.
I explain the most used approachs of Fog Of War on some succesfull videogames, why uses them and how implement the selected approach capable of:

-  Smooth Fog of War.
-  Put players with providing visibility sight based on radius.
-  Put example "Wards" that provides visibility on larger area with life time.
-  Capable of hide desired game entities outside player visibility sight range.
-  Manage multiple spots of visibility without uggly hacks and workarounds.
